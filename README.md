This is ShunPeng Bai's personal website. Powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> with <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> theme. I used the template of <a href="https://github.com/zishengz/zishengz.github.io">ZiSheng Zhang's Blog</a> and referrd to the <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/613068160">tutorial</a> written by ZiSheng Zhang.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/LICENSE).

Originally, **ShunPeng Bai's Blog** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
