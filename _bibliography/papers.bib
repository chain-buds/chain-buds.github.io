abstract  ={"Fluoroalkenyl moieties are often used as carbonyl mimics in medicine preparation{,} and thus the development of facile routes for the synthesis of such compounds is of great importance. In this work{,} we report a photocatalytic ring-opening addition of cyclic alcohols to α-(trifluoromethyl)styrenes{,} which underwent a proton-coupled electron transfer and β-scission process{,} delivering a great variety of remote gem-difluoroalkenyl ketone derivatives. This methodology can also be applied in the reaction of gem-difluorostyrenes and 1{,}1{,}2-trifluorostyrenes to access monofluoro- and 1{,}2-difluoroalkenyl ketones."},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
