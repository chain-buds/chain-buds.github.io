My name is ShunPeng Bai (白 顺鹏), a undergraduate student majoring bioengineering at Life Science and Technology school of Huazhong Agricultural University.
I am currently engaged in both study and research at the Green Pesticide Chemistry Laboratory under Prof. HuaiLong Teng and the Biocatalysis Laboratory led by Prof. ShuKe Wu.

I am passionate about the interdisciplinary field of biology and chemistry, focusing more on how living things sense magnetic fields through quantum effects and how these fields can change chemical reactions in a quantum way. I hope to create amazing results by controlling how unseen magnetic fields interact with sensors in complex systems. This work is to help us better grasp how complex systems in biology and chemistry work.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - bspchemy[at]gmail.com

<!-- - Statistical ensemble representation of dynamic clusters and restructuring surfaces in catalytic conditions.
- Development of global optimizers with grand canonical and multi-objective functionality for structure search of crystals, clusters, and surfaces.
- Realistic modeling of electrocatalytic interface to understand the roles of pH, electrode potential, solvation, and electrolyte additives.
- Direct and inverse design of functional molecules and materials for CO$_2$ capture and electroreduction. -->
